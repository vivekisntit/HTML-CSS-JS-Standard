    <hr />
    <h2>I'm BACK</h2>
    <p>and this time I'm here to stay</p>
    <h3>WHY?</h3>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Cuz I don't wanna waste all the potential in me just to die
      average, nah, Hell nah
    </p>
    <h3>How am I gonna make it through?</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;By Learning about how to attract money not bitches</p>

    <h2>What is success?</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Health</h3>
        <p>
          Nobody ain't shit until they got a properly functional body.
          <br />Once you've got a fucking fever, you can't do shit other than
          cripple through it while watching your body degenrate itself to
          <em>survive.</em>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Wealth</h3>
        <p>
          Without Money in your pocket you're worth nothing more than a pebble
          on the road, even the pebble might get more respect and get put in a
          fish pond but not you my friend.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Time</h3>
        <p>
          It isn't even a physical thing still made
          <em>even the greatest bend down on their knees.</em> Just like
          gravity, despite being the weakest force in the nature, it's the only
          one that shapes the way the universe looks. If you run out of time you
          ain't getting nothing back. <br /><em>So work</em> NOW.
          <em>There is</em> NO TOMORROW
          <em>my friend, you might not even have a tomorrow.</em>
        </p>

    <h3>Consistency</h3>
    <ul>

        <p>
          There is nothing in this world that cannot be achieved through
          consistent effort.

          Every man of value, every successful individual has been through hell
          to be where he is, good things don't come easy,in fact they come the
          hardest way and at last

    <h3>Iron Mind</h3>

      <li>
        <p>
          It's the rule of nature to rule out the weak, they might survive but
          not for long becuase the misery you create for your family lasts
          longer than wealth. Misery can be generational as all you need is a
          lineage of morons ready to accept their fate as an average individual,
          to die <em> average,</em>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <br />Going an extra mile at the end of the day after your body has
          already given up is what's called having an Iron Mind.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <br />The human body has an unimaginable potential but matrix won't
          let you see it, they make us weak and be at each other's throat so
          that they can do whatever the fuck they want. Once you unlock the true
          potential of yourself, nothing in the world can bow you down. And the
          key to that is, Iron mind. Doing what you don't like to do is what
          makes you a champion.
